Hi! I'm a **cybersecurity enthusiast** with a passion for ethical hacking,and vulnerability research.

I created this blog to:

- ðŸ“š **Record my learning journey**  
- ðŸ§  **Document hands-on experiments and studies**
- ðŸŽ¯ **Motivate myself to stay consistent and keep improving**

This space serves both as my personal knowledge base.
